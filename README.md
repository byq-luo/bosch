# TODO

*  make yolo work for arbitrary img sizes

* we could run a higher accuracy vehicle detector (detectron/mask-rcnn) every 20 frames or so and then use faster trackers from OpenCV. This would probably work really good.

* Batch process images instead of processing them one by one? (try to increase GPU utilization)

* We do not adjust the label time based on the lengths of the videos in a sequence.
